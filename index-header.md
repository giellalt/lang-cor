This page documents the work on the [Cornish language model](https://github.com/giellalt/lang-cor). The model uses the [Standard Written Form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Written_Form) of Cornish, and its lexicon in the one of the dictionary made by the [Cornish Language Partnership](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornish_Language_Partnership).

## Resources based upon the language model

* [Cornish online speller](https://divvun.org/proofing/online-speller.html) (click the blue ABC symbol and choose Cornish)
* [Downloadable speller for Cornish](https://divvun.org/proofing/proofing.html) (MS Word, LibreOffice)
