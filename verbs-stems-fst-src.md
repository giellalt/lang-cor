The regular verbs -- a discussion:

Overview over types
This is what  we were aspiring at in 2009:

Here, 1-5 are declension classes.
* vb1) -a     no i-Umlaut im Paradima
* vb2) -ya    ya-Verbs
* vb3) -es/-i i-Umlaut im Paradigma
* vb4) -he    he-Verbs
* vb5) -el/-i -C[l|n|m](r)-Verben
* And finally the irregulars: Suppletion im Paradigma

Continuation lexica:
This is what we have today:
* vb1 -a     (= v1 above)
* vbya -ya   (= v2 above)
* vbi -i     (= v3 above)
* vbhe -e    (= v4 above)
* vb the rest (= ??? above)
* Irregulars (the final cat above)

2020 verbs were added as follows:
verbs with -ya, -i, -he infinitive to vbya, vbi, vbye
verbs in -a other than -ya to vb1
all other verbs to vb

## Umlaut class verbs

* u0. Verbs that never have Umlaut?
* u1. Verbs that only have umlaut before an ending that contains <i>, <y>, <owgh> or imperative <ewgh>.
* u2. Verbs that have umlaut wherever (1) does, but also have the imperfect tense in <-yn, -ys, -i, -yn>.
* u3. Verbs that have umlaut wherever (2) does (including the imperfect tense rule), and also have the 3s pret in <-is>.
* u1 This means VA before suffixes containing <i y owgh> or imperative <ewgh>
* u2 This means VA before everything in Umlaut = 1, + the following: 3s and 3p present indicative, 3s and 3p imperative
* u3


Todo:
* for each stem class, split in umlaut type and make sub-contlexes.
* In theory, this gives us 6x4 = 24 verbal continuation lexica.

It is fortunately easier than that:
* -el verbs are always type 3: v5-u3
* some -i verbs are type 3: v3-u3
* and the rest are type 2: v3-u2
* he-verbs are all type 2: v4-u2
